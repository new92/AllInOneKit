I'm currently working on Linkedin and Instagram Phising Attack, The Social Media Accounts BruteForcer and a new Phising Tool with Python !
The Instagram PA (Phish. Att.) will be ready in 2 weeks and the new Phising Tool will take about 2 or 3 weeks (maybe less). I also plan to program a multi-tool for social media accounts that will be used either
for brute forcing accounts on various social media platforms or for information gathering on various social media platforms). Either way, I plan to program them
with different logic and code ! Stay Tuned...
